<h2>How to make the best pizza:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Proof the yeast:</h3> 
        <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
        <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
        <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h3>
        <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
        <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>
        <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Let the dough rise:</h3>
        <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
        <p>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</p>
    </li>
